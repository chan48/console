# Graphcool Dashboard

🚀  Official source of [dashboard.graph.cool](https://dashboard.graph.cool/) written in Typescript 2 and based on React & Relay

## Changelog

### [Milestone M3](https://github.com/graphcool/dashboard/milestone/3)
* Our designer were hard at work to bring you the new and awesome Action UI🎊!
* There was a day when a huge list of permissions would break the UI in the structure view but that day is not today. 🔮
* *Fixed*: During onboarding you would get stuck at "Add a Todo model". 
* *Fixed*: If you create a new model, it'll redirect you automatically to the model.

See **[here](CHANGELOG.md)** for a full list of all changes (features/bug fixes).

### IDE Setup (Webstorm)

We use a different version of TypeScript than the default Webstorm TypeScript compiler. That's why you have to do the following to get rid of all TypeScript errors.
Please run `npm install` before the setup.

1. Go to the `Preferences` _(macOS: "⌘ + ,")_ window
2. In the left list menu **select** `Languages & Frameworks > TypeScript`
3. **Click** on the `Edit...` button in the `Common` Panel
4. **Select** `Custom directory`
5. **Browse** to your `project directory` and then **select** `node_modules/typescript/lib` and **click** `OK`
6. **Click** `OK` again in the `Configure TypeScript Compiler`
7. **Click** `OK` in the `Preference` window
